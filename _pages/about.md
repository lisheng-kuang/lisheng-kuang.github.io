<span style="color:red"> **I am looking for a postdoc position centered on the research on Wearable robots (Soft-exosuits, Exoskeletons, Prosthetics,...)**</span>.

Ciao, I'm Lisheng Kuang, I'm now a PhD student at [Rainbow Team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/author/lkuang/), irisa, Rennes, France. 

My work during the PhD centers on the mechatronics design and control on wearable haptics/robots. In specific, I impelment the design, prototyping, testing, evauation and human subjects study on wearable assistive devices. 

I got my Master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, 2017, Shenzhen, China. 
After that, from 2017.1, I worked at Huawei Technologies till 2019.8, 
later on, I started the adventure as a research fellow at IIT, Genova, Italy, advised by Dr. [Ferdinando Cannella](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/ferdinando-cannella). 
From 2020.3, I moved to Rennes and joined Rainbow Team, as a Ph.D. student, under the supervision of Dr. [Paolo Robuffo Giordano](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/prg/) and Dr. [Claudio Pacchierotti](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/claudio-pacchierotti/).

* I successfully defend my PhD on June 23rd 2023, [video](https://youtube.com/live/rkTij_Y27F0)
* Our recent work has been accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Haptics, it contributes to the family of encounter-type/palmar-based haptic interfaces, and to the concept of modular haptic devices. check the paper here: 'A Wearable Haptic Device for the Hand with Interchangeable End-Effectors' [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148827), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rs0s9UN2fI)
* I'm going to defend my Ph.D. in the end of June, 2023
* Our paper titled 'Haptic Mushroom...' has been acepted by World Haptic Conference 2023, we ([Francescso Chinello](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id(accad1e3-5976-4e97-80aa-660e721126bd).html)) will present it in the conference, in July, Delft, the Netherlands. Come to try our Haptic Mushroom !
* We submitted our Work inProgress to the World Haptic Conference 2023, presenting our work on a Hapti Spider, we will present during the conference with a poster.
