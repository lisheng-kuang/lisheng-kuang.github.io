Ciao, I'm Lisheng Kuang (匡立生)

Exciting news!

2024

I am now a postdoctoral researcher at [Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics/wearable-robotics-laboratory). I have been working on wearable robotics in the Wearable Robotics Laboratory, since 2023. November.

I was a **Ph.D.** student at [Rainbow Team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/author/lkuang/) 2020.0 ~ 2023.7, irisa, Rennes, France. 

At the end of June 2023, I successfully defended my PhD, thesis title '[Ungrounded haptic interfaces for guidance and interaction rendering(https://theses.hal.science/tel-04208342/document)]'. [video](https://youtube.com/live/rkTij_Y27F0).
Much appreciation to my supervisors and the Jury members:

[Nathanaël Jarrassé](https://www.n-jarrasse.fr/),
[Christine Chevallereau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JzYkhbUAAAAJ&hl=en),
[Marie Babel ](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/marie-babel/).

My work during the PhD centers on the mechatronics design and control on wearable haptics/robots. In specific, I implement the design, prototyping, testing, evaluation, and human subjects study on wearable assistive devices. 

In August 2019, I started the adventure as a research fellow at IIT, Genova, Italy, advised by Dr. [Ferdinando Cannella](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/ferdinando-cannella). 
From 2020.3, I moved to Rennes and joined Rainbow Team, as a Ph.D. student, under the supervision of Dr. [Paolo Robuffo Giordano](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/prg/) and Dr. [Claudio Pacchierotti](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/claudio-pacchierotti/).
